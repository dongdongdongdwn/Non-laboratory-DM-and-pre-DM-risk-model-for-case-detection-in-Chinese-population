# Non-laboratory-DM-and-pre-DM-risk-model-for-case-detection-in-Chinese-population



Hi There,

Regarding the manuscript "Non-laboratory-DM-and-pre-DM-risk-model-for-case-detection-in-Chinese-population",  the ML model is presented here as a pickel file (pickle_model.dat). While the LR model has been formulated in the manuscript.
Due to personal data privacy directive, the raw data cannot be released.

BTW, the ML and LR were deployed to PC program using pyinstaller and the coding can be found in deployment file.

Thank you.

Best regards,
Dovey DONG
