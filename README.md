Hi There,

Regarding the manuscript "Non-laboratory-DM-and-pre-DM-risk-model-for-case-detection-in-Chinese-population",  the ML model is presented here as a pickel file (pickle_model.dat). The LR model has been formulated in the manuscript.
Due to personal data privacy directive, the raw data cannot be released.

Using the deployment file, the ML model and LR model have been deployed to PC program. The material compressed folder contains necessary components of model deployment. Run with deployment file with python will present the program.
